What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their
responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

Dont know the explanations in these docs are pretty garbage and I find them  a huge waste of time. 
I would apprecaite it if y'all could post ones with better explanations.  

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

see above



Why would we use a ternary operator?

Simpler code

  
Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
x === y ? true : false
